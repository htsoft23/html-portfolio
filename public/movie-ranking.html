<h1>The best movies according to Tamas</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>
  My favourite by far. <br />I watched it countless times because every time I
  find it showing on some TV channel I just can't not-watch it.
</p>
<h3>Captain Philips</h3>
<p>
  I really like Tom Hanks. This one is based on a true story, emotional movie.
</p>
<h3>A Million Miles Away</h3>
<p>
  Probably not an all-time favourite, but it came to my mind right now because I
  watched it recently.<br />Also based on true events.
